      <description>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning (RL) can be extended to multi-agent systems (MAS) by replacing the single agent MDP formulation with a more general Markov game, also known as a stochastic game (Shapley, 1953). A Markov game, introduced by Littman (1994) as an extension of the Markov decision process (MDP) formalisation, is a mathematical framework that uses game theory to reason about multiple interactive agents in a shared environment. It is formalised (Yang and Wang, 2021) by the tuple:</description>
