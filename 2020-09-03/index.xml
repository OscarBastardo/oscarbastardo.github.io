      <description>Angle Sum and Difference Identities Recently whilst revisiting trigonometry I came across a neat way of proving the angle sum and difference identities shown below:
$sin(\alpha+\beta)=sin(\alpha)cos(\beta)+cos(\alpha)sin(\beta)$
$cos(\alpha+\beta)=cos(\alpha)cos(\beta)-sin(\alpha)sin(\beta)$
I have used these formulas a number of times in the past to solve problems but I had not thought much about how they came to be. It was not until I learnt the visual proof I will describe on this post that I finally acquired a solid intuition about what these equations mean.</description>
