      <description>Blogging Adventure I presume lots of people are making the most of their self-isolation time and kicking off their side projects. In my case I have decided to start a blog. Yes, you might be thinking &amp;ldquo;yet another developer starting a blog&amp;rdquo;, to which I reply: you&amp;rsquo;re absolutely right. This is just a place I intend to use to publish knowledge I have acquired throughout the time I have been working as an engineer, in a way that hopefully people reading will find useful too.</description>
