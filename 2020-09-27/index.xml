      <description>Adding Numbers from 1 to N This is one of those little problems with a background story that can make us truly appreciate the ingenuity of mathematicians. There seem to be multiple versions of this story, but the most popular one can be summarised as follows:
Gauss (renowned mathematician and child prodigy) was 10 years of age and was part of an arithmetic class. His teacher came up with the idea of making his pupils add all the integers from 1 to 100, presumably to keep them busy and free himself to do other things.</description>
