      <description>Modulo Operation Recently I started a 30 day Coding Challenge on LeetCode and came across a use case for the modulo operation. I had seen it applied to the same problem before, but I had not really appreciated how versatile this operation is until then. I will explain what the use case was later on, but first I would like to go through some concepts related to division that most of us hopefully learnt in school.</description>
