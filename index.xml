      <description>Markov Decision Process Introduction One of the most fundamental problems in reinforcement learning is the representation of the environment, which comprises everything that exists outside the agent. The agent interacts with the environment through actions, and the environment in turn responds to the agent with rewards and with new new situations, as shown in Figure 1.

      <description>Adding Numbers from 1 to N This is one of those little problems with a background story that can make us truly appreciate the ingenuity of mathematicians. There seem to be multiple versions of this story, but the most popular one can be summarised as follows:
Gauss (renowned mathematician and child prodigy) was 10 years of age and was part of an arithmetic class. His teacher came up with the idea of making his pupils add all the integers from 1 to 100, presumably to keep them busy and free himself to do other things.</description>

      <title>Angle Sum and Difference Identities</title>

      <description>Angle Sum and Difference Identities Recently whilst revisiting trigonometry I came across a neat way of proving the angle sum and difference identities shown below:
$sin(\alpha+\beta)=sin(\alpha)cos(\beta)+cos(\alpha)sin(\beta)$
$cos(\alpha+\beta)=cos(\alpha)cos(\beta)-sin(\alpha)sin(\beta)$
I have used these formulas a number of times in the past to solve problems but I had not thought much about how they came to be. It was not until I learnt the visual proof I will describe on this post that I finally acquired a solid intuition about what these equations mean.</description>

      <title>Modulo Operation</title>

      <description>Modulo Operation Recently I started a 30 day Coding Challenge on LeetCode and came across a use case for the modulo operation. I had seen it applied to the same problem before, but I had not really appreciated how versatile this operation is until then. I will explain what the use case was later on, but first I would like to go through some concepts related to division that most of us hopefully learnt in school.</description>

      <description>Blogging Adventure I presume lots of people are making the most of their self-isolation time and kicking off their side projects. In my case I have decided to start a blog. Yes, you might be thinking &amp;ldquo;yet another developer starting a blog&amp;rdquo;, to which I reply: you&amp;rsquo;re absolutely right. This is just a place I intend to use to publish knowledge I have acquired throughout the time I have been working as an engineer, in a way that hopefully people reading will find useful too.</description>
